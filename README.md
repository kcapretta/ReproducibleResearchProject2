# Reproducible Research Project: Analysis of weather environmental and health impact

This project is an assignment from John Hopkins University Data Science class (Reproducible Research) for Coursera. This course can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research. The R Publication for this data can be found here: http://rpubs.com/kcapretta/537081. 

## Synopsis

This analysis involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

To examine which weather events are the most destructive, this analysis looks at the rates of injury, death, an property damage for all events since 1990.
